<h3><p class="italic">I'm Mays and I'm a 15 years old girl who is full of energy and Vitality. in my opinion the best expression of life that it's a passion in something ! people spend long periods of time looking for ther passion! but I think I found mine, It is the feeling of happiness ! everyday I woke up I find a new skill and I have a new adventure ! writing, singing, drawing, swimming, reading, volunteering and so many other things that make this simple life much better ! my main rule in life is to live the moment as it is ! there is no time to care about the past ! we just have to do things that make us proud in the future ! we have to work as hard as we can ! we have to do the best we can ! and the most important is to make a simple cute connection with the time ! I know I can do my best to reach the top of this huge mountain ! we all can and have to reach the top . at the end I have to say that looking at the close future makes me confident and sure that one day people will say : she caught her goal.</p><h3>
